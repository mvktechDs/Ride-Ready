        <p class="section1para">To ensure Ride Ready continues to make a positive impact to the rides ecosystem and to maintain our commitment to zero-commission rides and 100% direct payment, we've introduced Namma Yatri Plans for drivers. This is a small fee that we'll be collecting from our driver partners to cover basic costs of running their beloved app.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions by Drivers</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>Why should I subscribe to Ride Ready Plan ?</summary>
            <p>At Ride Ready, our mission is to empower drivers and bring about a positive transformation in their lives. We believe in creating a ride-hailing ecosystem that benefits both drivers and riders. With our innovative approach, we introduced Zero Commission Rides and embraced 100% Openness, revolutionizing the ride-hailing industry.</p>
            <p>To continue making a positive impact on both drivers and riders, the Ride Ready team has been tirelessly optimizing costs. While we've successfully reduced several expenses, infrastructure costs such as maps and servers are necessary to ensure thousands of daily rides run smoothly. To sustain Ride Ready and maintain our commitment to zero-commission rides and 100% direct payment, we've introduced Ride Ready Plans.</p>
            <p>These plans, available in our Driver app, offer two options: Daily Unlimited and Daily Per Trip. Not only are these plans significantly more affordable than those offered by other aggregators, but they also align with our fundamental principle of transparency. We remain steadfast in our promise of zero-commission rides and enabling direct payments from customers to drivers.</p>

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I cancel my subscription at any time?</summary>
            <p>You can stop the subscription anytime by canceling your Autopay in the Namma Yatri Partner app. You will then be in the manual payment plan where you will be able to take rides until you reach the credit limit.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Will I still get rides if I don't subscribe to Autopay?</summary>
            <p>Yes. There are no changes to any of the features in the app. You will still be able to get ample rides. However, if you don't set up Autopay, you will have to make manual payments where you will only be able to take rides until you reach the credit limit. To avoid any sudden surprises or your account not getting rides due to the credit limit getting exhausted, we recommend you subscribe to Autopay.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How will the subscription affect my earnings?</summary>
            <p>You will still continue to get 100% payment for each of your rides directly from the customers. We're just requesting you to pay a very nominal amount to access the driver app. Also, for days when you don't take any rides, no plan fee will be charged to you.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What happens if I have technical issues with the subscription?</summary>
            <p>If you face any technical issues with your subscription, please reach out to us on our Driver Support line at +91 6304401744.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Are there any offers on the Subscription?</summary>
            <p>Yes, there are offers for early subscribers. The sooner you subscribe, the higher the discount you'll get on your subscription fee. However, the offers are only applicable to drivers who chose UPI Autopay for their plans. Check the app for more details on latest or current offers.</p>

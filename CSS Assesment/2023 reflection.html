         <h4 class="heading1">A JOURNEY OF SCALING EMPATHY</h4>
        <h1 class="heading2">Ride Ready - 2023 Reflection üéâ</h1>
        <p class="section1para1">Reide Ready has become Chennai most loved auto app, since its formal launch in January 2023. This success stems from the unwavering support of our community, which includes both our dedicated drivers and the citizens of Chennai. From the beginning, our mission has been to forge a community-driven mobility solution that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge technology, innovative design, and people-first approaches.</p>
        <p class="section1para2">Our endeavors throughout 2023 have focused on three key</p>
        <p class="section1para3">objectives:</p>
        <ol class="section1orli">
            <li>Scaling Empathy</li>
            <li> Cost Optimization</li>
            <li>Embracing the Open and Hi-Tech Future</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="section2">
        <h2 class="heading3">Scaling Empathy</h2>
        <p class="section2para1">Mobility is a population scale problem, which can be tech enabled and made into a seamless utility like UPI-payments. At Juspay, our initial exploration was in developing ticketing solutions to facilitate digital payments for public transportation. Along this journey, we realized the importance of empathy and recognized the need to empower drivers, the key service providers, to make mobility truly sustainable. Embracing a people-first approach, we opted not to act as an intermediary between drivers and customers but to directly connect them instead. Our model of direct payments to drivers, marked by absolute transparency, has reinstated their agency, enabling them to earn more and provide better customer service.</p>
        <p class="section2para2">We place a strong emphasis on participatory development, regularly gathering feedback from both our driver and rider communities. The community has begun promoting the app amongst themselves, making word-of-mouth and referrals our top growth drivers. For instance, drivers in Mysuru and Tumkuru have come forward to promote the initiative as their own, and we are looking forward to such hyperlocal ownership across the country. Over the past year, this synergistic relationship has attracted over 1.7 lakh
            drivers to join our platform, supported by more than 40 lakh customers.</p>
        <p class="section2para3">Our product decisions are centered around fostering empathy between drivers and customers. This people-centric approach has helped Ride Ready witness several milestones in 2023:</p>
        <ul class="section2ul">
            <li>Over 1.7 lakh new drivers</li>
            <li>Drivers earning over ‚Çπ300 crore commission-free</li>
            <li>Completion of over 22 million rides</li>
            <li>A marked improvement in search-to-ride conversion rates, from ~10% to ~30%</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="section2para4">Our app store ratings and customer surveys show that Ride Ready (RR) enjoys higher levels of satisfaction and a better Net Promoter Score (NPS). This is a reflection of the positive experiences shared by both drivers and customers, rooted in a culture of mutual respect and trust: drivers provide a commendable service, and customers support the drivers earnings.</p>
        <p class="section2para5">Furthermore, we launched Purple Rides to make mobility disability-friendly. With assistance from EnAble India, Namma Yatri revamped its product and operations, introducing ‚ÄúPurple Rides‚Äù specifically designed for users with visual, hearing, or physical impairments. This service has been utilized by over 10,000 customers and 5,000 drivers, amounting to ~40,000 trips. Additionally, we are actively working on enhancing women's safety and promoting initiatives for women drivers (Mahila Shakti program in partnership with Bengaluru City Police) to foster financial independence and make mobility more inclusive.</p>

    <section class="section3">
        <h2 class="heading4">Cost Optimization</h2>
        <p class="section3para1">To provide mobility solutions like an utility, it is critical to optimize costs. We operate on a nominal subscription fee model for drivers, which in turn benefits both parties: drivers enjoy higher earnings and customers experience lower fares. Achieving this mutually beneficial scenario hinges on our ability to heavily minimize tech & operation costs and the support of the community to minimize the marketing costs.  We have innovated and made significant investments  in this regard, as evidenced by the dramatic reduction in various cost components from January to December 2023. Here's a breakdown of per trip costs:</p>
        <ul class="section3ul">
            <li>Cloud & Map Costs: Reduced from ‚Çπ43.7 to ‚Çπ1.2</li>
            <li>Operations: Decreased from ‚Çπ12.6 to ‚Çπ0.7</li>
            <li>Marketing: Lowered from ‚Çπ11.1 to ‚Çπ0.7</li>
            <li> Product Dev, Engineering & Central Costs: Reduced from ‚Çπ150.1 to ‚Çπ5.6</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section3para2">Consequently, our total operational costs have seen a drop from ‚Çπ219.5 in Jan ‚Äò23 to ‚Çπ8.6 per trip in Dec‚Äò23, enabling our journey towards sustaining this win-win model for our drivers and customers:</p>
        <table class="section3table">
            <tr>
                <th>Cost per trip</th>
                <th>jan'23</th>
                <th>Dec'23</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cloud & Map Costs</td>
                <td>43.7</td>
                <td>1.2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Operations</td>
                <td>12.6</td>
                <td>0.7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Marketing</td>
                <td>11.1</td>
                <td>0.7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Product Dev, Engineering & Central Costs</td>
                <td>150.1</td>
                <td>5.6</td>
            </tr>
            <t>
                <td>Total Costs</td>
                <td>219.5</td>
                <td>8.6</td>
            </t>
        </table>
        <p class="section3para3">The driver subscription revenue currently stands at approximately ‚Çπ2.5 per trip. To ensure the sustainability of the overall initiative, we need to further reduce costs through innovation, relentless optimizations, continued community support and increased scale.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section4">
        <h2 class="heading5">Embracing the Open and Hi-tech Future</h2>
        <p class="section4para1">At Ride Ready, innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We are proud to be the first app to adopt the Beckn protocol and the first mobility player to join the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). We believe the future is going to be powered by open systems and hence we have open-sourced our code and have embraced an open-data and open-roadmap approach.</p>
        <p class="section4para2">We also realized that partnerships with the government are key to make the multi-modal strategy work. We've supported the West Bengal Government in digitizing the pre-paid taxi counters and launching a cab booking service (Yatri Sathi). We are collaborating with ONDC, the public transport corporations, and ecosystem players like Google Maps to enhance the experience and adoption of metros/buses. Many of these features are set to launch in 2024.</p>
        <p class="section4para3">Our product innovations focus on efficiency, reliability, and customer delight. For instance, our ride dispatch algorithm is optimized for short pickup distances and minimal cancellations, benefiting drivers, and customers. We are also actively researching to innovate in EV & shared mobility space.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section5">
        <h2 class="heading6">In Summary</h2>
        <p class="section5para1">True transformation in urban mobility, for the benefit of both citizens and service providers, requires the collaboration of Samaaj (Community), Sarkar (Government), and Bazaar (Business). Ride Ready is a step in this direction, focusing on enabling the service providers. The year 2023 has been eventful, marked by our efforts to scale empathy, optimize costs, and establish our commitment to open systems. Our vision is also to be a catalyst for a seamless multi-modal transportation system that is super comfortable yet still affordable for the general public. As we move into 2024, we look forward to sustaining this vision and learning and growing together with all our stakeholders! Thank you!</p>
